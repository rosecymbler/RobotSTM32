# RobotSTM32
This project focuses on creating an autonomous robot that detects walls within 40 cm using a sonar sensor. Upon detecting a wall, the robot calculates the angle between itself and the wall, then adjusts its direction by turning left or right to avoid the obstacle, while being controlled via Bluetooth through an embedded system.
